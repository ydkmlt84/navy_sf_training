## Career
 I am currently a US Navy Officer recruiter stationed at NTAG Richmond. The BEAST of the EAST!! My mission is GENOFF. It has been interesting so far, to say the least. Before this I was on the USS Laboon, USS San Antonio, USS Leyte Gulf, USS Thomas S. Gates. Shore duty: MARMC and then MARMC again. :) I am retiring in Febuary of 2025.

## Personal Life
I am from Ft. Worth, Texas. I do not like the Cowboys. I have lived in Hampton Roads since 2006. This is where I currently call home. 

I have a lovely wife, who is a prior CTR1. None of my career would have been possible without her love and support. I mean it too because she probably wont ever see this website. HAHA

I have 3 kids. My son is 20 years old, my daughter just turned 14, and my other son is 12.

I am a big nerd and love software that makes my life easier. Salesforce has the potential, when it comes to my job, it's just super confusing and the user experience/ease of use is not there. I have learned little ways to make it work for me and other people at my NTAG have benefited from me sharing it. So, I decided to make this to document some of the stuff.
