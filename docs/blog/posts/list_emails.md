Being able to send a mass email to a lot of applicants is extremely useful. E-talent is hella busy just loading up SF with applicants. You could look today and there are 200, and tomorrow there are 100 new ones.

It can start to get overwhelming seeing them all, and then leadership says, "Hey we have 1.7k no activity leads that we need to get cleared out." 

You: "Ok, how do I do that?"

 This isn't hard at all. It just isn't obvious on how to go about sending a list email to a lot of people. I mean why would there be a button that takes you right to it? That's too easy.
